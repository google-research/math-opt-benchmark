There are currently 40 data files.

These data files are the test problem sets IV to XIII and A
to C in Table 1 of J.E.Beasley "An algorithm for solving  
large capacitated warehouse location problems" European 
Journal of Operational Research 33 (1988) 314-325.

These test problems essentially (but see Appendix in the  
above paper) include the standard Akinc and Khumawala test
problems for the capacitated warehouse location problem.

The following table gives the relationship between test 
problem set and the appropriate files:

Problem set        Files
IV                 cap41, ..., cap44
V                  cap51
VI                 cap61, ..., cap64
VII                cap71, ..., cap74
VIII               cap81, ..., cap84
IX                 cap91, ..., cap94
X                  cap101, ..., cap104
XI                 cap111, ..., cap114
XII                cap121, ..., cap124
XIII               cap131, ..., cap134
A                  capa
B                  capb
C                  capc

The format of these data files is:
number of potential warehouse locations (m), number of
customers (n)
for each potential warehouse location i (i=1,...,m): 
capacity, fixed cost
for each customer j (j=1,...,n): demand, cost of allocating
all of the demand of j to warehouse i (i=1,...,m)

For files capa, capb and capc (which are large files) in
order to save file space a single data file is used to 
represent four test problems. The word 'capacity' in these
files should be replaced by the appropriate numeric value 
from Table 1 of the above paper in order to generate each 
of the four problems in problem sets A, B and C.

The value of the optimal solution for each of these data 
files is given in the file capopt.

The largest file is capc of size 1300Kb (approximately).
The entire set of files is of size 5000Kb (approximately).

I added the optimal solutions to this package. For each problem
we have an optimal solution in the corresponding .opt-file as 
follows: For each city (in order of appearance in the problem file)
we denoted the facility it is connected to in the optimal solution.
