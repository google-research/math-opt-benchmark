# MathOpt Benchmark

A set of benchmarks for linear and integer programs as defined using the
MathOpt API in [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization).
Unlike the traditional MIPLIB benchmarks, these benchmarks focus on incremental
solves, decompositions, and using callbacks.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
